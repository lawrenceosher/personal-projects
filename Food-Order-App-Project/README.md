This is one of the practice projects in the updated course (as of 10/23/23) of Udemy Course: React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This project fetches a list of meals from a pre-built backend and users can then add different meals to their cart, edit quantities of their meals within the cart, and then go to a checkout form. Users can then submit their orders to the pre-built backend with their meals and user information.

The highlighted focuses of this project were gaining experience with the Context API, working with side effects, using the built-in useReducer hook, building custom hooks, using native browser features to retrieve submitted data via forms, sending HTTP requests, handling loading and error states, and working with Modals.

I followed along with the instructor for this project.

To run the project:

1. Change directories into the backend directory and then type npm install and then npm start in a new CLI.
   This is so that the backend project that was in the starter files will load and HTTP requests can be sent.
2. Change back into the root directory and then type npm install and npm run dev to run the frontend of the project on your local machine.
