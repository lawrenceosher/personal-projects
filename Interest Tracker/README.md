First Practice Project associated with the old Section 9 (course was updated on 10/23/23) of the Udemy Course: React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This practice project is an Interest over time Tracker. For each year, it shows the total savings of the user, the different interest amounts per year that increase as the years go on, the total interest accumulated for each year, and the invested capital.

I followed along with his walkthrough for the most part, but there were slight changes in my project from his. I used multiple states for the different user inputs to easily keep track of them all, changed the way the output was conditionally rendered, and I reset the table of outputted results with my resetHandler function where he didn't.

To run the project, open the src folder, type npm install in the CLI and then npm start to start the project on your local machine.
